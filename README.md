# RCJ_IR_ball
Opensource IR ball for robocup junior soccer

This project is still work in progress!!!

# TODO list:
1. Make version of drive board for self asembly 
2. Update swithch to smd version for asembly
3. Change weight from curent 89g to 95g with strengtenign week parts of shelfs
4. Make panel version of all PCBs for kit
5. Create proper code with gyro auto turn off feature
6. Check avalibility of all components around world
7. Test version with homemade PCBs
8. Make some ready to send kits for testing with 'early adopters'
9. Corect spelling (put all text in gramarly)

# Quick guide how to create your ball
## Stuff you nead
Every ball consists of 3 main parts:
1. Top and botomm shells
2. PCBs
3. Mechanical parts

## 1. Top and botom shells
To get your shells you can 3d print it your self or ask a friend who have SLA 3d printer, or order it from pcbway or other manufacture with 3d printing service. Here are some resins and manufactures we tried, if you found some other please open issue and let as know so we can add it to a list.

|   | Resin name                | Were to buy | Cost per ball | Strenght | Transparenci | Photo |
|---|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|--------------|-------|

## 2. PCBs
For PCBs we have to main warints. One cheaper and easyer to made in home with just on of swith, and other with gyro,buzzer and ws2812b that can swith off it self when it will not move for 3 minutes. 
So you have 3 main options how to get your PCBs:
1. Get them almost fully asembled by JLCPCB or PCBWAY (need to solder LEDs)
2. Get just PCBs and buy components form digikey/mouser/lcsc or other manufacture and solder it all your self (can chose simler wersion of pcb so need for hot air station)
3. Make them and cut them all by your self in home (need to order componets) using fotolitografy or other process. TODO do detail guid how to do that

### Components and where to get them
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AJk5qBYIz7-Oj68zrsEcClqDoz_VDrp_WEVsXvldfIE/edit#gid=0
(all componets are realy easy to get and they are in stock in at least 4 eshops)
TODO put in in table here
## 3. Mechanical parts
This is easiest part. You just need to buy folowing ithems from your local hardawe store or from internet(few sugested websides listed)
1. 2x M3 screw
2. 2x M3 nut
3. 8x brass/coperr standoff M3 10mm
TODO be more specifick and prowide links to websides were to get them


# Ball testing
When you make your ball now is the time to test if it actualy works. Here are few ways how to do that:

## Test qvaliti of ir light:
1. Use IR seeker (easy test with lego mindstor)
2. Use TSOP
3. Make your own ir seeker (link to repo how to meke your own ir seeker)
4. Use smartphone(not proof of working, just good assumption)

## Test mechanicl integrity:
1. dorop it form 1m and if it survives it is ok

## Test power consumption:
1. Use ampere meter
2. Check if it have sam ir intensity for 3h (use new bateries)

Reference testing data:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1isDrJiC3cLQZJ-q2lvDSGFadgaxJweIT?usp=share_link

TODO provide exact step by step how to test it with each metod

# How it works

TODO
Ball neads to emits ir light on wawelengt of 940nm in this modulated way:

to save energy a ...TODO
And drive PCB work like this.... TODO
